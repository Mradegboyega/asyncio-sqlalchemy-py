AsyncIO with SQLAlchemy and ORM Learning Project
Project Overview

This project is designed to explore and understand the integration of AsyncIO with SQLAlchemy and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). The goal is to demonstrate the asynchronous capabilities of SQLAlchemy in combination with an ORM to perform database operations in an efficient and non-blocking manner.
Project Components
connect.py

This module serves as a standalone script to establish a connection to a SQLite database using AsyncIO and SQLAlchemy. It includes the following functionalities:

    Definition of a users table with columns (id, username, email, bio).
    An async_main function demonstrating the creation of tables, insertion of data, and a simple select query.

orm.py

This module focuses on defining ORM models using SQLAlchemy's declarative base. The User and Comment classes represent tables in the database. It includes the following functionalities:

    Definition of User and Comment classes with relationships and foreign keys.
    An insert_data function to add sample data to the tables.
    A select_update function showcasing a select query on the User table.
    The async_main function that establishes a connection, creates tables, and executes either data insertion or a select query.

Getting Started

    Installation:
        Ensure you have Python installed.
        Install required packages using pip install sqlalchemy[asyncio] aiosqlite.

    Run connect.py:
        Execute python connect.py to see the basic AsyncIO and SQLAlchemy functionalities. It creates tables, inserts sample data, and performs a select query.

    Run orm.py:
        Execute python orm.py to run the ORM-based portion of the project. This script demonstrates creating ORM models, inserting data, and performing a select query using AsyncIO.

Key Concepts Covered

    Asynchronous database operations with AsyncIO.
    SQLAlchemy ORM for defining and interacting with database models.
    Defining relationships and foreign keys in SQLAlchemy.
    Executing DDL (Data Definition Language) statements asynchronously.

Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on experience in utilizing AsyncIO with SQLAlchemy and ORM for efficient and non-blocking database interactions. It's a valuable resource for learning asynchronous programming concepts in the context of database operations.
